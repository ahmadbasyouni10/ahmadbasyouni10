# 📮 About Me

My name is Aidan and I am a Computer Science student!

self.age = 19
self.traits = ["nerd", "short", "wavy hair"]
self.hobbies = ["Coding", "Soccer", "Streaming"]
```

I have been interested in coding from the age of 11. I started coding using block Scratch code and grew to learn languages such as Python and Java. At 13, I used my Java knowledge to experiment with Minecraft plugins and started to create my own. Around 14-15, I started creating games in Unity, where I dipped my toes into C#. Now, I am exploring Web Design and languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have tried tools such as Node.js and React, and I am still learning
